# SR2-PC-Ported-Map-CTS
This is the CTS files for the ported maps that lack actual gamemode spawns and what not.
Feel free to edit these files and make your own spawns, weapon placements etc.
If you want me to include your changes be sure to do a pull request.
Just be aware your cts files if requested to merge will be looked over as well as tested.
Please do not include any GoTR related content to these cts files, any GoTR based content (weapons etc)
will be ignored.

This is on github due to my thread here: https://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/threads/sp-to-mp-ported-maps-unused-maps.20623/
